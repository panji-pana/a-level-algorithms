# a-level-algorithms

A collection OCR A-Level (H446) algorithms (2.3.1 on the [specification](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/170844-specification-accredited-a-level-gce-computer-science-h446.pdf)) in Python. 

## Current algorithms:
- Search Algorithms (linear, binary)
- Sorting Algorithms (bubble, insertion, merge, quick)

## Current data structures:
- Hash Tables (insert, remove, search)

## Planned algorithms:
- Pathfinding Algorithms (Dijkstra's shortest path, A\*) *These do not need to be coded, just followed through*

## Planned data structures:
- Trees (depth-first, breadth-first)
- Binary Search Trees (preorder, postorder, inorder, insert, remove)
- Stacks (push, pop, peek)
- Queues (enqueue, dequeue, peek)
- Linked list (add, delete, traverse)
